🔐 Cybersecurity Labs – Week 5
Welcome to Week 5 of the Cybersecurity Lab series. This week focused on foundational exploration of system processes, networking analysis, and real-world attack simulations. The labs utilized tools like Wireshark, Windows Task Manager, PowerShell, and packet captures to examine how systems operate under normal and malicious activity.

🧠 Key Labs and Learnings
1. Exploring DNS Traffic (Lab 7.3.1.6)
Used Wireshark to inspect DNS queries and responses.

Filtered packets with udp.port == 53.

Analyzed source/destination MAC and IP addresses, recursive queries, and DNS resolution for domains like www.cisco.com.

Takeaway: DNS traffic can reveal critical network metadata, useful for both defenders and attackers.

2. Attacking a mySQL Database (Lab 7.3.2.4)
Reviewed a SQL injection attack via a .pcap file in Wireshark.

Observed commands like 1=1 and UNION SELECT revealing database info.

Extracted table names, user data, and password hashes.

Used CrackStation to crack hashes (e.g., hash 8d3533d7... => password Charley).

Mitigation: Parameterized queries and input validation.

🔧 Tools Used
Wireshark: For traffic analysis and protocol inspection.

CyberOps Workstation VM: Environment for secure lab execution.

CrackStation.net: Online hash cracking tool.

🛡️ Core Concepts Covered
DNS Protocol Analysis

SQL Injection Mechanics

Network Reconnaissance Techniques

Defensive Strategies: Input sanitization and traffic filtering
