Since Week 1 to Week 7 as part of my structured cybersecurity training, covering Windows and Linux security, network analysis, penetration testing basics, VPN setup, firewall configuration and digital forensics.

🗓️ Overall Weekly Performed Tasks

✅ Week 1: Windows Security Fundamentals

Identified and analyzed running processes using Task Manager and TCPView.

Managed user accounts via GUI and PowerShell.

Explored Windows threads, handles, and registry entries using Process Explorer.

Monitored system resources to detect performance bottlenecks.

✅ Week 2: Linux Fundamentals & File System

Navigated Linux CLI using commands like ls, cd, pwd, nano.

Worked with text files and practiced permission settings (chmod, chown).

Explored Linux server processes (ps, netstat) and reviewed system logs (/var/log/).

✅ Week 3: Networking Basics

Practiced traceroute to analyze network paths.

Introduced to Wireshark for capturing and analyzing Ethernet frames.

Understood TCP 3-way handshake and UDP communication through captures.

✅ Week 4: Network Traffic Analysis

Used Wireshark to:

Compare TCP vs UDP traffic behaviors.

Examine DNS traffic and HTTP vs HTTPS differences.

Performed Nmap scans to identify open ports and services.

Learned about Access Control Lists (ACLs) via Cisco Packet Tracer labs.

✅ Week 5: Firewalls & Packet Filtering

Configured Linux-based firewalls to manage incoming/outgoing traffic.

Created and tested iptables rules and ACLs for packet filtering.

Analyzed packet flow using Packet Tracer.

✅ Week 6: VPN Configuration

Configured VPNs using PPTP and OpenVPN.

Set up site-to-branch VPNs to enable secure remote access.

Explored NAT and IPsec protocols in VPN architectures.

✅ Week 7: Cyber Attacks & Forensics

Conducted SQL injection attack simulation on a mySQL database.

Analyzed captured traffic to extract hashes and cracked them using CrackStation.

Read and interpreted server logs to identify suspicious activities.

Explored DNS traffic captures to understand metadata leakage.

📌 Final Reflection
Over the past seven weeks, I gained strong foundational skills in cybersecurity through hands-on labs. I started by learning Windows fundamentals, including process management, user account administration, PowerShell commands, and monitoring system resources. I then built Linux skills such as navigating the command line, managing file permissions, editing text files, reviewing system logs, and understanding server processes. In networking, I explored tools like traceroute and Wireshark to analyze Ethernet frames, TCP handshakes, UDP traffic, DNS queries, and HTTP/HTTPS protocols. I practiced using Nmap for scanning and configured Access Control Lists in Packet Tracer to manage network security. I also learned to configure Linux-based firewalls with iptables and set up VPNs using PPTP, OpenVPN, and site-to-branch connections to ensure secure communications. Finally, I simulated SQL injection attacks on a mySQL database, analyzed captured traffic to extract and crack password hashes, and performed server log analysis to detect security breaches. Overall, these labs enhanced my skills in Windows and Linux administration, network traffic analysis, penetration testing basics, firewall configuration, VPN setup, and digital forensics.
