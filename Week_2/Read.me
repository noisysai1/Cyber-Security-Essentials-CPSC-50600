# 🔐 Cybersecurity Labs - Week 2

This week's focus was on **Linux OS fundamentals**, **IoT vulnerabilities**, and **filesystem and log management**. Below is a detailed summary of all labs and concepts covered during Week 2 of the course.

## 📁 Labs Completed

### 1. Learning the Details of Attacks (Lab 1.1.2.6)
- Researched IoT vulnerabilities across four sectors: **Industry**, **Energy**, **Healthcare**, and **Government**.
- Key insights:
  - Common vulnerabilities include use of default passwords, lack of encryption, and outdated firmware.
  - Attackers exploit IoT through malware, social engineering, or remote code execution.
  - Mitigation includes firmware updates, strong credentials, encrypted communication, and secure physical access.

### 2. Working with Text Files in the CLI (Lab 3.1.2.6)
- Used **SciTE** and **nano** to:
  - Create and edit files (`space.txt`).
  - Save and open files using GUI and terminal.
- Learned basics of command-line editors:
  - `nano`: Save (`Ctrl+O`), Exit (`Ctrl+X`), Help (`Ctrl+G`), and navigation commands.
- Explored user and system configuration file locations: `/home/username` and `/etc`.

---

### 3. Getting Familiar with the Linux Shell (Lab 3.1.2.7)
- Practiced basic commands:
  - `pwd`, `cd`, `ls -l`, `mkdir`, `echo`, `>`, `cat`, `man`.
- Created directories (`cyops_folder1` to `cyops_folder4`) and navigated using absolute and relative paths.
- Learned to use redirection (`>`) to output to a file and `man` pages to explore command documentation.

---

### 4. Linux Servers (Lab 3.1.3.4)
- Identified running processes using `ps -elf` and `ps -ejH`.
- Used `netstat -tunap` to view network services and detected the **nginx** server listening on port 80.
- Differentiated between user processes and background services (e.g., `nginx`, `rsyslogd`, `lightdm`).

---

### 5. Locating Log Files (Lab 3.2.1.4)
- Located logs under `/var/log/` (e.g., `messages`, `kern.log`, `nginx/access.log`).
- Analyzed:
  - Web server logs for client requests.
  - OS logs for kernel events (network link up/down, USB connection).
- Used commands: `cat`, `more`, `man nginx`, `ps | grep nginx`, and explored `nginx.conf`.

---

### 6. Navigating Linux Filesystem and Permissions (Lab 3.2.2.4)
- Explored filesystem structure using `lsblk`, `mount`, and `umount`.
- Mounted second drive (`/dev/sdb1`) to `/home/analyst/second_drive`.
- Viewed and modified file permissions using `ls -l` and `chmod`.
  - Example: `-rw-r--r--` means owner can read/write; group and others can only read.

---

## 🛠 Key Tools & Commands
- `nano`, `SciTE` (editors)
- `mkdir`, `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `man`, `echo`, `cat`, `more`
- `ps`, `netstat`, `mount`, `umount`
- `/var/log/`, `/etc/nginx/`, `/home/analyst/`
- File permissions: `r` (read), `w` (write), `x` (execute)

## 📌 Summary
This week provided foundational Linux skills and introduced basic server management, file handling, permissions, and log analysis. These are critical for any cybersecurity analyst dealing with Linux-based environments.
