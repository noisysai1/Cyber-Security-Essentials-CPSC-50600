🛡️ Week 1 - Cybersecurity Labs Summary
🔍 1. Identifying Running Processes (Lab 2.0.1.2)
Explored running Windows processes using TCPView from Sysinternals Suite.

Observed lsass.exe (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) running in C:\Windows\System32.

Launched and closed Firefox, noted how new processes appeared/disappeared in TCPView.

TCPView helps visualize active TCP/UDP endpoints and associated processes.

🧵 2. Processes, Threads, Handles & Registry (Lab 2.1.2.10)
Used Process Explorer to:

Investigate parent/child relationships (e.g., cmd.exe → conhost.exe).

Kill processes and observe how it terminates associated child processes.

Explored:

Threads Tab to inspect execution details.

Handles Tab to view open file/memory references.

Navigated Windows Registry to locate and modify EulaAccepted for Process Explorer.

Changing value from 1 to 0 prompts license agreement again on next launch.

👥 3. Creating and Managing User Accounts (Lab 2.2.1.10)
Created local user User1 with password Train1ng$.

Checked folder access permissions in C:\Users and found:

User1 had limited access.

Admin account retained full access to all profiles.

Promoted User1 to admin and then reverted to standard user.

Deleted the user using Control Panel and Computer Management tools.

💻 4. Using Windows PowerShell (Lab 2.2.1.11)
Ran basic commands: dir, ping, ipconfig in both cmd and PowerShell.

Learned that:

dir maps to Get-ChildItem.

PowerShell allows extended network diagnostics with netstat -abno.

Used PowerShell to clear the Recycle Bin via Clear-RecycleBin.

📊 5. Windows Task Manager Exploration (Lab 2.2.1.12)
Explored Processes, Services, and Performance tabs:

Observed process hierarchy and memory usage.

Identified conhost.exe and cmd.exe relationship.

Verified network activity and physical memory usage (e.g., 847MB used, 3.1GB available).

Used Task Manager to end Firefox and confirm immediate process termination.

📈 6. Monitor and Manage System Resources (Lab 2.2.1.13)
Managed Routing and Remote Access service:

Observed status changes in Task Manager and Network Connections.

Created Performance Logs using Data Collector Sets in Performance Monitor:

Logged memory usage (Available MBytes) every 4 seconds to a .csv file.

Visualized resource usage in real-time and report mode.

Deleted logs and cleaned up manually.

🧠 7. Cybersecurity Case Studies (WK1 DB2)
Analyzed four major cyberattacks:

Home Depot (2014) – POS malware, 56M card details stolen.

Target (2013) – POS malware, 40M cards + 70M customer details exposed.

Stuxnet (2010) – ICS malware, targeted Iran's nuclear centrifuges.

Sony Pictures (2014) – Data theft, political motives, wiper malware used.

Each case involved different tools, motivations (financial, political), and outcomes (data breach, system damage).
