Week 4 – Cyber Security Labs & Activities
This repository contains lab documentation, practical exercises, and notes for Week 4 of a cybersecurity fundamentals course. The focus is on understanding system processes, account security, Windows & Linux command-line interaction, packet analysis and basic network security concepts using tools like Wireshark and Cisco Packet Tracer.

🔍 Key Topics Covered
🔧 Windows System Security
Identifying Running Processes: Used Task Manager and tasklist to inspect active processes.

Exploring Threads, Handles, and Registry: Investigated low-level Windows internals using tools like Process Explorer.

Managing User Accounts: Created and managed Windows user accounts via GUI and CLI.

Windows PowerShell Essentials: Ran administrative commands to manage services, accounts, and audit policies.

Monitoring System Resources: Analyzed CPU, memory and disk usage using Task Manager and Resource Monitor.

💻 Linux Security Fundamentals
Command-Line Navigation: Practiced with ls, cd, cat, grep and permissions commands.

Working with Text Files: Edited and managed system files through the Linux CLI.

Linux Servers and Logs: Accessed and reviewed system logs to detect unauthorized access.

Filesystem & Permissions: Navigated through directory hierarchies and set appropriate permissions.

🌐 Network Security & Traffic Analysis
Understanding Attacks: Learned about common cyberattack types, vectors, and their impact.

Tracing Routes: Used tracert to map out packet routes across networks.

Wireshark Labs:

Ethernet Frame Analysis

TCP Three-Way Handshake

DNS over UDP

TCP vs. UDP traffic

HTTPS and encrypted traffic

Nmap Lab: Performed basic network scanning to identify active hosts and open ports.

🔐 Access Control & Packet Flow

ACL Demonstration (Cisco Packet Tracer): Implemented and tested Access Control Lists to control traffic.

Packet Flow Visualization: Analyzed packet routes and observed rerouting due to link failures.

📜 Industry Relevance

Key skills: Security monitoring, cloud, IoT security, governance and incident response

Hands-On Tools:

Hack The Box

OWASP WebGoat

Google Gruyere
