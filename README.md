## ‚úÖ Week 1 - Summary

### üîê Security Concepts Covered:
- **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Threats and vulnerabilities in modern systems
- User authentication practices
- Security Operations Center (SOC) overview
- Fundamentals of the Windows Operating System for cybersecurity

### üß™ Labs Completed:

#### 1. Identify Running Processes
- Used `TCPView` to analyze active Windows processes and network endpoints.
- Observed how launching applications like Firefox dynamically created new processes.

#### 2. Explore Processes, Threads & Handles
- Employed `Process Explorer` to trace parent/child processes and threads.
- Investigated registry edits, including EULA acceptance keys.

#### 3. Create & Manage Local User Accounts
- Created a standard user, modified privileges, and enforced file access controls.
- Reviewed user group memberships and tested access restrictions.

#### 4. Windows PowerShell
- Compared command prompt vs. PowerShell capabilities.
- Ran commands like `netstat`, `Get-Process`, and `Clear-RecycleBin`.
- Viewed and analyzed network connections and process IDs (PIDs).

#### 5. Windows Task Manager
- Navigated tabs: **Processes**, **Services**, **Performance**.
- Monitored memory usage, CPU activity, and network statistics.
- Killed processes and reviewed real-time resource allocation.

#### 6. Monitor & Manage System Resources
- Configured **Performance Monitor** and **Data Collector Sets**.
- Managed Windows services such as **Routing and Remote Access**.
- Generated CSV reports to track system memory performance.

#### 7. Cybersecurity Case Study (WK1 DB2)
- Analyzed 4 major incidents:
  - Home Depot & Target POS breaches
  - Sony Pictures Entertainment hack
  - Stuxnet industrial control malware
- Compared motivations (financial, political) and outcomes (data theft, infrastructure damage).
