Week 3 ‚Äì Cybersecurity Labs

This repository contains completed exercises from multiple hands-on labs designed to build foundational skills in cybersecurity, Linux, Windows operations and network traffic analysis using tools such as Wireshark and PowerShell.

üìÅ Contents
üîπ Windows Security & System Monitoring
Identifying Running Processes
Learn how to examine active processes, assess system load and understand process IDs and resource usage.

Exploring Threads, Handles, and Registry
Understand how Windows manages system resources and how to inspect active handles, threads and registry keys.

Creating User Accounts in Windows
Create, configure and verify new user accounts through GUI and CLI methods.

Using PowerShell
Execute common administrative tasks like user creation, service management and system querying using PowerShell.

Windows Task Manager
Explore Task Manager tabs to monitor performance, startup processes, services and resource usage.

Monitoring System Resources
Learn how to monitor and manage CPU, memory and disk usage to identify bottlenecks or anomalies.

üîπ Cybersecurity Foundations
Learning the Details of Attacks
Analyze various attack vectors (DoS, phishing, malware) and categorize them by goals and techniques.

Visualizing the Black Hats
Examine attacker motives, methods and impact through real-world cybercrime visualizations.

üîπ Linux Fundamentals
Working with Text Files in CLI
Use commands like cat, grep, head and tail to manipulate and inspect text files.

Getting Familiar with the Linux Shell
Basic navigation, command execution, directory manipulation and file operations in a Linux terminal.

Linux Servers Overview
Identify common server roles (e.g., DNS, web, mail) and understand how to interact with them.

Navigating Filesystems & Permissions
Learn Linux directory structures and how to assign, modify and verify file permissions.

Locating Log Files
Identify and interpret critical Linux log files such as /var/log/syslog, auth.log and others.

üîπ Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
Tracing a Route
Use tools like traceroute to visualize network paths and latency across nodes.
